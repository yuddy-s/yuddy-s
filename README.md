## Hey there 👋

I'm Yudhveer, a computer science student at Stony Brook University and full-stack developer.

I build whatever I can imagine - from web apps to AI experiments.

If an idea pops into my head and it's interesting, chances are I'll try to build it and ship it.

My main stack: **React, Node.js, TypeScript** for web | **C** for systems
