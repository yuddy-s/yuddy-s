## Hey there 👋

I'm Yudhveer, a computer science student and full-stack developer.

I build whatever I can imagine - from web apps to AI experiments.

If an idea pops into my head and it's interesting, chances are I'll try to build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React, Node.js, and Express** for web development, and **C** for systems-level work.

...still stuck at skechers though :(
